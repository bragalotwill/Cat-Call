Coding Pipeline

1. Collar
    a. (BLE) make connection to beacons
    b. (Offline) calculate TxPower - initial RSSI when 1m away from Beacon
    c. calculate RSSI
    d. (BLE) send (t, [RSSI(t, i) for i:[1, 3]], [TxPower(t, i) for i:[1, 3]], Mic[t], Acc[t]) for a time t

2. Desktop Arduino
    a. (BLE) receive Collar tuple
    b. (Serial) print tuple data

3. Desktop
    a. (Serial) receive tuple
    b. calculate cat_position
    c. calculate mood
    d. calculate motion_type
    e. (LAN) write calculations to database

4. Android
    a. (LAN) receive calculations from database
    b. display cat_position
    c. display mood
    d. display motion_type


cat_position:
    x, y, room = [wila_bedroom, tony_bedroom, adit_bedroom, corridor, corr_bathroom, 
                    liv_room, kitchen, kitch_bathroom];
    a. get kalman filter prediction
    b. receive rssi, TxPower, accelerometer
    c. update kalman filter

mood:
    cat sound = [angry, defence, fighting, happy, huntingmind, mating, mother, paining, resting, warning];
    a. run audio through cat sound ml (if audio is loud enough?)
    b. return label

motion_type:
    position_change, velocity;
    motion = [still, stalking, walking, running]

Database:
    time; x; y; room; sound; motion

Android:
    a. need map of the house - use beacons to make floor plan (worst case tape measure)
    b. make icons for ginny and fe - happy, resting, neutral, paining, angry
    c. show speed for cat - vector or text? 
    d. send notifications for pain, anger
